                <p>Pioneered by ancient Nepalese craftsmen, this style of architecture travelled to other parts of the world like China and Tibet via Nepalese artisans only later.
                The pagoda style of architecture features prominently in the structures of ancient Nepalese shrines and temples, with multiple tiers of roofs arranged in ascending order from top to bottom, supported by intricately carved wooden struts. The protruding windows are characterised by latticed architecture, which has a criss-cross pattern. Originally made of gold and alloys such as brass and bronze, this style is believed to have originated somewhere around the beginning of the 13th century.</p>

                <p>Monuments based on this style of architecture of Nepal has a typical hemispherical dome shape with a pyramid-like structure on top and a square base. Some Stupa monuments have Buddhist chanting or theologies carved beautifully on them, while some are built to preserve the relics of Buddha and his disciples. Believed to have been introduced by Emperor Ashoka in Nepal, this style is said to represent the five elements of Buddhism, namely, Earth, water, fire, air and space.</p>

                <p>Another testimony of the brilliance of the Nepalese architects of the ancient times, Shikhara means ‘mountain peak’ according to Sanskrit translation, and hence the shape of a Shikhara style monument resembles a mountain peak or a pyramidal shape. Highly elaborated and intricate artworks adorn the exteriors of shikhara style monuments or temples.</p>
